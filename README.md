# Hello Express   

---
This is the repository for **`glitch-hello-express`**, a simple Node app built on Express, hosted within a [Glitch](https://glitch.com) [app container](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sleet-raja?path=package.json:1:0).

Each Glitch project runs inside its own virtual machine container.


## Project 

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- App Server File: `server.js`
- Frameworks and packages are defined in `package.json`
- App secrets are stored in `.env`.

## Glitch

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.
